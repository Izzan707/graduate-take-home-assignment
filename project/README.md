# Full-Stack Web Application

## Description
This repository contains a solution to a coding challenge that involves designing both a frontend web application and a backend API. The project is divided into two main parts:

- Frontend Application (UI only): A web application built with React.js that includes user registration, login, logout, and a profile page where users can update and save their "About Me" section as either a draft or submit it.
- Backend API: A Node.js server connected to a MySQL database to handle user registration and login. The backend allows users to register, login, and logout.
Features

## Frontend Application
User Registration: A registration form to create a new user.
Login & Logout: A login form to authenticate users and a logout button to end the session.
User Profile: A profile page where users can update their information and manage their "About Me" section.
Draft & Submit: Users can save their "About Me" section as a draft or submit it.

## Backend API
User Registration: API endpoint to register a new user with hashed passwords.
User Login: API endpoint to authenticate users and return a JWT token.
User Logout: Simple logout mechanism to invalidate the session.
